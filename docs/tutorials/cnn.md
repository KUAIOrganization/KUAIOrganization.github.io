# Making a Convolution Neural Network, a CNN

this is a simplified intro to cnnâ€™s, enough to understand how they "see" images, which is there most common usecase.

to those of you who have come from the data shapes section, a CNN will work on any 2d array, but will also perform better if the neighbors in the 2d array are related. An Image is literally a 2d array (every pixel is an rgb list, pixels from a 2d list), and nearby pixels are related (either an object or a boundary), so their most common usecase is image classification, but any 2d array works

The CNN architecture looks like this:
